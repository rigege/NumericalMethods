# NumericalMethods
Various algorithms for solving all kinds of numerical method problems

Solving Linear Systems of Equations (Gauss-Seidel, Gaussian Elimination with Partial Pivoting)
  - Put coefficient matrix in A.txt, put solution vector in B.txt

Roots of Non-Linear Equations (Bisection, Single-Point Interation, Newton-Raphson)
  - Equation in the functions at the bottom can be replaced
